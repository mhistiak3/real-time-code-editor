- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **NPM** or **Yarn**

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

   cd real-time-code-editor
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start both the frontend and backend development servers:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. To run the backend server separately (with hot reloading for the backend):
   ```bash
   npm run server:dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/
   ```

### Build for Production

To build the frontend for production:

npm run build
```

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the Vite development server.
- `npm run build`: Installs dependencies and builds the frontend.
- `npm run server:dev`: Starts the Node.js backend server with **Nodemon** for hot-reloading.
- `npm run start`: Starts the backend server without hot-reloading.
